## Prequisites

- Sidebery

## Installation
- Download the repo as a zip, export it in to your chrome-folder
- Move the user.js file to your profile dir (the parent of the chrome dir)

overwrite your settings).

### Acknowledgements
[Naezr](https://github.com/Naezr) - Icon logic and some sideberry logic.

изз - starting working on a similar project in the glazewm discord, prompted me
to get started on the work.
